The Gözcü project is focused on developing a comprehensive network discovery tool aimed at facilitating the identification of connected devices and open ports within a specified IP range. This tool streamlines the meticulous examination of network security by employing ARP scanning for device discovery and port scanning techniques to accurately identify open ports on the discovered devices.

Methodologically, the tool provides a comprehensive functionality package designed for network administrators, security analysts, and penetration testers, leveraging Python libraries such as scapy, manuf, and requests. Specifically, it offers deeper insights into network services by utilizing banner grabbing to extract detailed service banners and versions associated with open ports, providing valuable information to administrators about the types and versions of services running on their networks.

By furnishing information about connected devices, their vendors, and the services operating on open ports, the tool enables administrators to proactively address potential security vulnerabilities and gain insights into the robustness of their network infrastructure.
